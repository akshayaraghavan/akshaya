                                                      Part â€“b

1.Getting three inputs from the user and displaying which one is greater one. 

class large
{
     public static void main(String args[])
   {
      int a, b, c;
      System.out.println("Enter three integers ");
      Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
      a = in.nextInt();
      b = in.nextInt();
      c= in.nextInt();
      if (  a> b&& a > c )
         System.out.println("First number is largest.");
      else if ( b > a && b > c )
         System.out.println("Second number is largest.");
      else if ( c > a && c > b )
         System.out.println("Third number is largest.");
      else   
         System.out.println("Entered numbers are not largest");
   }
}
Output
Enter three numbers 
10 9 4
First number is largest

2.Student Marks grade system
  
  import java.util.Scanner;
  class grade
  {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  int marksgot,passMark;
  char grade;
  passingMarks = 40;
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.println("Input marks scored by you");
  marksObtained = input.nextInt();
  if (marksgot >= passMark) {
  if (marksgot > 90) 
        grade = 'A';
        else if (marksgot > 75)
        grade = 'B';
        else if (marksgot> 60)
        grade = 'C';
        else
        grade = 'D'; 
        System.out.println("You passed the exam and your grade is " + grade);
        }
       else 
       {
       grade = 'F'; 
       System.out.println("You failed and your grade is " + grade);
       }
     }

Output:
You passed the exam and your grade is c
Input marks scored by you
39
You failed and you grade is F
